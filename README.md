# ChirpMotd

## Simple modular tweeting account app in Ruby ##

All the work is in progress now.

I'm writing this app to learn about and API services ad twitter.
I read some quotes from the a microservice backend (the API are served through Passenger for Apache: see it in action [here](https://tuxmal.noip.me/dadi.html) [1] and tweet it (splitted in chunk of 140 chars) on my twitter account @RaspiTux.

You must change **config/config.json** inserting the consumer key and secret, and also the oauth token and token secret, that you'll obtain registering your account and your app on Twitter.

You can run this app either by using cron/anacron (use **bin/cron_chirpmotd**) or as a daemon (use **bin/chirpmotd**). The latter method will spread evenly trough the 24h the messages generated by the modules in the modules folder.

To add anoter module simply add into the modules folder another file respectng this interface:

```ruby
module ChirpQuote
  class AdvertiseMe
    # initialize will do every preparation you need:
    # service_uri is the URI passed to the class at initialization time
    # logger is an istance of Logger to log what you need
    def initialize(service_uri, logger)
      ...
    end

    # get will return the message to be tweeted
    def get
      ...
      message = 'this will be tweeted'
      ...
      return message
    end
  end
end
```

Feel free to watch into this project, fork it, pull any request and suggest any change!

Cheers!
